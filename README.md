# SOAP Note Templates
SOAP Note Template Add-In for Microsoft Word


Description: This add-in allows for faster SOAP note writing using saved templates in a CSV file (Example: 'test.csv'). The templates are inserted when the user types the pound sign, a key phrase, and presses the return/enter key (Ex: '#diabetes'). New templates can be added by editing the CSV file using Excel or using the add-in's editor userform.
# Compatibility
This is designed for Word 2007 and greater on Windows OS. This template is not compatable with MAC OS since it uses the dictionary object.
# Installation
To install, please download 'SOAP Notes Add-In.dotm'.

To run the program, follow these steps:


1. Click the 'SOAP Notes' tab
2. Click the 'Load Template' button and open a CSV file
3. Click the 'Key Bind' button
4. Start using the program!
